# **BrandoLang: The Standard Language for Brand Guidelines**

**BrandoLang** is a high-level **description language** designed specifically for capturing, managing, and applying brand guidelines. It provides a **structured vocabulary** and **taxonomy** that enables brands to maintain **consistency, clarity, and control** over their identity across different touchpoints, whether it's for AI-generated content, design assets, or marketing materials.

By providing a unified framework, BrandoLang simplifies the process of defining brand elements such as **strategy, visual identity, verbal identity, application guidelines**, and **AI generator rules**. This makes it easier to ensure that brand guidelines are correctly interpreted and applied by both human creators and AI systems.

## **Why BrandoLang?**

Brand management is a complex process that involves various elements, from visual design to tone of voice, across multiple platforms. This complexity is compounded when different teams, departments, or external partners work on brand-related tasks, leading to inconsistencies and misinterpretations.

BrandoLang addresses these challenges by offering:
- A **standardised ontology** for brand guidelines.
- A **machine-readable** format that ensures brand rules are enforced in AI-generated content.
- An easy-to-understand language that makes brand guidelines **accessible** to all stakeholders, from designers to copywriters and developers.

## **The Core Elements of BrandoLang**

BrandoLang is built around five key components, each representing a crucial aspect of brand identity:

### 1. **Brand Positioning**
Brand Positioning component defines the brand's **mission, vision, values, positioning**, and **messaging frameworks**. It includes elements such as the **3Cs** (Company, Customers, Competitors), ensuring that brand positioning is aligned with the organisation's strengths, customer needs, and market differentiation.

- **Mission**: The overarching purpose of the brand.
- **Vision**: The long-term aspirations and goals.
- **Values**: Core principles that guide actions and messaging.
- **Positioning**: How the brand wants to be perceived in the market.

### 2. **Visual Identity**
Visual Identity covers all aspects of how the brand looks across different platforms, including **logos, color palettes, typography**, and **imagery styles**. This ensures visual consistency and recognisability across all touchpoints.

- **Logos**: Guidelines for using primary, secondary, and monochrome logos.
- **Colours**: Approved colour palettes with hex codes, RGB values, and usage contexts.
- **Typography**: Fonts, sizes, line heights, and usage rules.
- **Imagery**: Photography styles, graphic elements, and patterns.

### 3. **Verbal Identity**
Verbal Identity defines the brand's **tone of voice**, **key vocabulary**, and **copywriting guidelines**. This ensures that every piece of written content aligns with the brand's personality and communicates the intended message consistently.

- **Tone of Voice**: Descriptors and examples of how the brand speaks.
- **Key Vocabulary**: Preferred and prohibited terms to maintain consistency.
- **Boilerplate Copy**: Standardized phrases for "About Us" sections, product descriptions, and more.

### 4. **Application**
The Application section details how brand elements are applied across different **platforms** and **content types**. This covers guidelines for **social media posts, email campaigns, presentations**, and more, ensuring that the brand is represented consistently.

- **Marketing Materials**: Rules for brochures, posters, and advertisements.
- **Digital Platforms**: Guidelines for website design, app interfaces, and email signatures.
- **Internal Communications**: Templates for employee emails, memos, and internal presentations.

### 5. **AI Generator Guidelines**
As more brands leverage AI for content creation, ensuring that these systems adhere to brand guidelines is crucial. The AI Generator Guidelines provide a framework for **prompt templates, quality assurance**, and **validation rules**, ensuring that AI-generated content aligns with the brand's identity.

- **Prompt Templates**: Predefined instructions for generating branded content.
- **Quality Assurance**: Checks for tone, style, and visual consistency.
- **Validation Tools**: Tools and techniques to ensure content meets brand standards.

## **How Does BrandoLang Work?**

BrandoLang is designed to be both **human-readable** and **machine-readable**, allowing seamless integration into your brand management workflows. Here’s how it can be used:

### 1. **Define Your Brand Guidelines**
Brand managers, designers, and copywriters can use BrandoLang to define every aspect of the brand, from the tone of voice to logo usage rules. These definitions are stored in a structured format (e.g., **JSON** or **YAML**), making it easy to share and implement across your organisation.

### 2. **Generate BrandoLang Index and Reference Documents**
BrandoLang is composed of an **index document** that references multiple **detailed documents** covering each aspect of the brand. This structure ensures that all guidelines are organised, accessible, and easy to update.

### 3. **Integrate with AI Systems and Design Tools**
BrandoLang can be integrated with **AI content generators**, **design software**, and **content management systems** to ensure that all content adheres to your brand guidelines automatically. For example, when an AI generates a social media post, it will reference BrandoLang to ensure the tone, imagery, and messaging align with the brand.

## **Taxonomy Structure**

BrandoLang uses a **hierarchical taxonomy** to categorise brand elements, making it adaptable to various levels of complexity. This taxonomy allows you to define brand elements broadly or in granular detail:

| **Category**       | **Description**                                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Strategy           | The brand's mission, vision, values, positioning, and messaging framework. |
| Visual Identity    | Guidelines for logos, colors, typography, and imagery.  |
| Verbal Identity    | Tone of voice, vocabulary, copywriting rules, and storytelling principles. |
| Application        | Instructions for applying brand elements across different platforms. |
| AI Generator       | Prompts, quality assurance, and validation rules for AI-generated content. |

## **Extending BrandoLang**

BrandoLang is **extensible**. Brands can add new elements, attributes, or categories to capture any unique aspects of their identity. This means that as your brand evolves, so can your BrandoLang guidelines.

## **Interoperability and Integration**

## **Using BrandoLang Syntax for LinkedIn Content**

The updated structure ensures that LinkedIn-specific guidelines, including **footer images**, are clear and actionable for both human creators and AI systems. This makes it possible to maintain brand consistency across all LinkedIn content.

### **Best Practices for LinkedIn Content with BrandoLang**
- **Use the Footer Image**: Include a footer image in your LinkedIn articles as specified, ensuring it matches the required aspect ratio (e.g., 1280x300).
- **Visual Consistency**: Ensure header and footer images are cohesive and reinforce the brand’s visual identity.
- **Provide Value**: For LinkedIn articles, make sure the content is informative and offers valuable insights to your audience.

By incorporating these LinkedIn elements into your BrandoLang schema, you ensure that your brand maintains a consistent and professional presence on LinkedIn, capturing the attention of your target audience.

Here’s the **BrandoLang Taxonomy Overview** page adapted into British English, inspired by the FidesLang taxonomy guide. This version focuses on how BrandoLang organises and categorises the various elements of brand guidelines, ensuring consistency, clarity, and ease of implementation across different touchpoints.

# **BrandoLang Taxonomy Overview**

## **Introduction to the BrandoLang Taxonomy**

The **BrandoLang Taxonomy** provides a comprehensive and structured way to define, manage, and implement brand guidelines across all content, design, and communication channels. It offers a **standardised vocabulary** for describing the various aspects of a brand's **Strategy, Visual Identity, Verbal Identity, Application**, and **AI Generator Guidelines**. This taxonomy ensures that everyone—whether human creators or AI systems—has a consistent understanding of the brand's requirements.

BrandoLang's taxonomy is designed to be **flexible, hierarchical**, and **extensible**, allowing brands to define elements at different levels of detail and adapt as their brand evolves.

## **Why Use the BrandoLang Taxonomy?**

The BrandoLang Taxonomy serves as the **foundation** for defining and enforcing your brand guidelines. It enables:

- **Consistency**: Ensures all brand-related elements are structured and communicated uniformly.
- **Scalability**: Provides a system that can grow with your brand, allowing you to add new categories, elements, or guidelines as needed.
- **Interoperability**: Ensures that your brand guidelines can be integrated with various content creation tools, AI systems, and design software.

## **The Structure of the BrandoLang Taxonomy**

The BrandoLang Taxonomy is divided into five core categories:

| `storytelling_guidelines` | Object       | Principles for how the brand tells its story.            |

### 4. **Application**
The Application category defines how brand elements are used across different channels, including **social media, marketing materials, internal communications**, and more. It ensures that the brand is applied consistently, no matter where it appears.

## **Extending the BrandoLang Taxonomy**

BrandoLang is designed to be **extensible**, meaning you can add new categories, elements, or rules as your brand evolves. For example:

- If your brand develops a unique packaging style, you can add a `packaging` category under the `application` section.
- You might want to add an additional **content type** under Verbal Identity for **press releases** or **podcast scripts**.

This flexibility ensures that your brand guidelines remain relevant and comprehensive as your brand grows and adapts to new opportunities.

## **Interoperability and Integration**

The BrandoLang Taxonomy can be integrated with various content creation and management systems, AI tools, and design software, ensuring seamless enforcement of brand guidelines across your organisation.

- **Formats**: BrandoLang supports **JSON** and **YAML**, making it easy to work with across different tools.
- **Integration**: You can integrate BrandoLang with tools like **Adobe XD**, **Figma**, **content management systems**, and **AI content generators** to ensure consistent brand representation.

## **How to Use the BrandoLang Taxonomy**

1. **Define Your Guidelines**: Start by populating the BrandoLang taxonomy with your brand's specific elements, from mission and values to colour codes and tone of voice.
2. **Implement in Your Workflow**: Integrate BrandoLang with your existing workflows to ensure all brand-related content adheres to the guidelines.
3. **Adapt and Evolve**: As your brand grows, update the BrandoLang taxonomy to reflect any changes or new elements.

## **Examples of the BrandoLang Taxonomy in Action**

Here’s how the taxonomy might look when applied to different brand elements:

#### **Strategy Example (YAML Format)**

## **Final Thoughts**

The BrandoLang Taxonomy is a powerful tool for maintaining a consistent and cohesive brand identity across all channels and content types. Its structured, hierarchical approach makes it easy to define and enforce brand guidelines, ensuring that every piece of content—whether created by humans or AI—aligns with your brand’s values, tone, and visual identity.

The **BrandoLang Manifest** acts as a centralised file that provides an overview of all the brand guideline documents, assets, and resources that make up your brand's identity within the BrandoLang framework. It essentially serves as a **table of contents** or an **index** for your brand's guidelines, helping you keep track of where each component is located, how they are related, and how they can be accessed. This makes it easier for both humans and AI systems to find, reference, and apply the appropriate brand elements.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of how the BrandoLang Manifest works, what it should include, and how it integrates with your brand guidelines.

# **BrandoLang Manifest**

## **Introduction**

The **BrandoLang Manifest** is a master document that lists all the individual brand guideline documents and resources, ensuring that every aspect of your brand is clearly organised and easily accessible. The manifest is typically stored in **JSON** or **YAML** format and contains metadata about each resource, such as its title, description, file type, URL, and how it fits within the brand's overall structure.

## **Why Use the BrandoLang Manifest?**

- **Centralisation**: Provides a single, comprehensive reference point for all brand guidelines and assets.
- **Clarity**: Helps keep track of all documents, ensuring that nothing is overlooked or misused.
- **Integration**: Facilitates integration with content management systems, design tools, and AI generators, enabling them to access the latest brand guidelines seamlessly.
- **Scalability**: Makes it easy to expand your brand guidelines as your organisation grows or as new elements are added.

## **Structure of the BrandoLang Manifest**

The BrandoLang Manifest is structured as a **top-level index document** that references all the individual brand guideline documents. Here’s a breakdown of the key elements included in the manifest:

| **Field**              | **Type**           | **Description**                                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `brand_name`           | String             | The name of the brand.                                           |
| `version`              | String             | The version number of the manifest (e.g., "1.0").                |
| `last_updated`         | String (Date)      | The date the manifest was last updated.                          |
| `documents`            | Array of Objects   | A list of all the brand guideline documents and assets.          |

Each entry in the `documents` array should include:

|------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id`                   | String             | A unique identifier for the document or asset.                   |
| `title`                | String             | The title of the document or asset.                              |
| `description`          | String             | A brief description of what the document covers.                 |
| `category`             | String             | The category it belongs to (e.g., "Strategy", "Visual Identity").|
| `file_type`            | String             | The type of file (e.g., "PDF", "JSON", "YAML", "PNG").           |
| `s3_url`               | String             | The URL where the document is stored (e.g., on AWS S3).          |
| `last_modified`        | String (Date)      | The date when the document was last modified.                    |
| `keywords`             | Array of Strings   | Keywords related to the document’s content for easy search.      |
