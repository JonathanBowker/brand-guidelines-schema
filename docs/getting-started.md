# Getting Started with the Brand Guidelines Schema (BGS)

## Introduction

Welcome to the Brand Guidelines Schema (BGS)! This guide will help you get started with implementing BGS, whether you're establishing new brand guidelines or transitioning your existing guidelines into a standardised format. By following this guide, you'll be able to effectively document, structure, and apply your brand identity using the BGS framework.

## Step 1: Understanding the BGS Structure

Before you begin, it's essential to familiarise yourself with the overall structure of BGS. The schema is divided into the following main sections:

1. **Strategy**: Captures your brand's mission, vision, values, and target audience.
2. **Verbal Identity**: Defines the tone of voice, messaging framework, vocabulary guidelines, and boilerplates.
3. **Visual Identity**: Covers the brand's logo, colour palette, typography, imagery, and graphic elements.
4. **Application**: Details how the brand should be applied across various channels such as digital, print, and environmental branding.
5. **Additional Resources**: Includes downloadable assets, examples, and training materials.

Familiarising yourself with these sections will help you implement BGS more effectively.

## Step 2: Preparing Your Brand Information

Start by gathering all relevant information about your brand. This might include existing brand guidelines, mission and vision statements, tone of voice documents, visual assets, and any other materials that define your brand's identity. Having all this information ready will make it easier to populate the BGS fields accurately.

### Tips for Preparation
- Collect existing brand documentation, if available.
- Ensure that key stakeholders (e.g., brand managers, marketing teams, designers) are involved in the process.
- Identify areas where your brand guidelines may need updating or expansion.

## Step 3: Populating the BGS Fields

Once you have your brand information prepared, you can start populating the BGS fields. Here's a breakdown of how to approach each section:

### **1. Strategy**

- **Mission Statement**: Describe the core purpose of your brand. What drives your organisation, and what impact do you aim to have?
- **Vision Statement**: Outline your long-term goals and aspirations. What future do you envision for your brand?
- **Values**: List the fundamental principles that guide your brand's actions and decisions.
- **Target Audience**: Identify your primary and secondary audiences, including their demographics, interests, and needs.

*Example:*
```json
"strategy": {
  "mission_statement": "To inspire sustainable living.",
  "vision_statement": "A greener future for all.",
  "values": ["Sustainability", "Innovation"],
  "target_audience": {
    "primary_audience": {
      "description": "Environmentally conscious individuals",
      "age_range": "25-45",
      "location": "Urban areas"
    }
  }
}
